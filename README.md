# hello-world
first programming practice 
My name is Caroline Rose and I am an Industrial Engineering Major! I was not able to take Intro to IE this semester because of time conflicts, so I'm supposed to take an extra tech elective in place of it so that I can still graduate in the Spring. I have 5 classes this semester now and I'm gonna be stressed but I know I can get through it with God.
